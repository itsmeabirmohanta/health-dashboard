## ðŸ“± Usage

- **Dashboard**: View all health metrics at a glance
- **Metrics**: Detailed view of individual health metrics
- **Analytics**: Advanced analytics and historical trends
- **Settings**: Configure thresholds, units, and sync intervals

## ðŸ”„ Data Simulation

The dashboard uses simulated data to mimic real wearable devices. In a production environment, this would be replaced with API calls to actual wearable device platforms like Fitbit, Apple Health, or Google Fit.

## ðŸ“‹ Roadmap

- [ ] User authentication
